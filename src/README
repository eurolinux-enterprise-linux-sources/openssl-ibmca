ABOUT

This package contains the dynamic IBMCA engine.

BUILDING

 Requirements: OpenSSL 0.9.8, libICA

 By default, the build will assume that you have a custom openssl installed
in /usr/local/ssl.

 $ configure [--enable-debug] [--with-openssl=/path/to/custom/openssl] \
             [--with-engines-dir=/path/to/openssl/engines/directory]
 $ make
 # make install

Included in this package is a sample openssl.cnf file (openssl.cnf.sample),
which can be used to turn on use of the IBMCA engine in apps where OpenSSL
config support is compiled in. In order to enable the IBMCA engine, the
content from this file should be concatenated to the existing openssl.cnf file
on the host.

During the build process, the path to the engines/ directory is substituted in
for the dynamic_path parameter in the ibmca section. By default, this path to
the engines/ directory is relative to the OpenSSL installation target. With no
parameters passed to the ./configure script, this target is /usr/local/ssl,
and so the default entry in the sample openssl.cnf file is:

dynamic_path = /usr/local/ssl/lib/engines/libibmca.so

If OpenSSL is installed to a different location, then the --with-openssl=
option should be passed to the ./configure script. For instance, if
--with-openssl=/usr is given, then the entry in the sample openssl.cnf file
is:

dynamic_path = /usr/lib/engines/libibmca.so

If the OpenSSL engines directory is located elsewhere, then that location must
be specified in the --with-engines-dir= option. For instance, if the engines/
directory is under /usr/lib64, then the ./configure script will need the
option --with-engines-dir=/usr/lib64/engines, which will produce this entry in
the sample openssl.cnf file:

dynamic_path = /usr/lib64/engines/libibmca.so
